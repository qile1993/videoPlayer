00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.750
Ah, Yoji, You got work today, right?

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.890
Oh, yep, but I resigned since it was too tired.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.750
Again?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.920
Don't make a fuss.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.160
Ah....Just wait.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.190
Wow! You got this!

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.360
You said you want this, right?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.060
Thanks, that's so nice of you.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.800
You'll say more touching moment tonight.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700
This is the touching film festival right?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.470
Ahah, you knew that from TV show?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.940
Nope, because I'm a infomation genius.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.840
After the movie, shall we go for dinner?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.570
There is an Italian bistro just open.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.310
Magazine?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.640
Nope, this time from Internet.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.250
Well, I expect that so much!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.950
But...could we pay the bill seperately?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.290
You know I almost have no money now.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.650
Ah?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.590
I'm just out of work.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.560
Please.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.790
Excuse me, can I have an adult ticket?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.690
Your license?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.260
License?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400
Before buying tickets I need to show my driving license now?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.370
Hurry up.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.870
License.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.640
Here.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.410
Not this.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.740
Pardon? It's driving license, right?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940
What happen? You forgot to bring the license?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.740
What do you meaning by 'forgot'?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.550
Em, what's this?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.750
Adult license?

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.520
Ah, what the hell it is?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.720
I couldn't go to movie if I haven't got this?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.230
No adult lisence, arrest him!

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.830
Ouch! That hurts!

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.530
What are you doing!

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.960
Let me go!

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.060
Why? You don't have adult license?

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.900
Are you an adult?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.330
Of course I am!

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.100
Ouch! Let me go!

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.970
Wait! Open the door!

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.570
Open it!

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.150
What's the matter?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.180
Where am I now?

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.820
Nice to meet you.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.760
My name is Takashi.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.700
Are you based here?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
Could you please tell me...

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.670
What the hell has happened?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.670
If you meet a stranger first time, you need to greet him first.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.440
What?

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.880
The lowest level of the adult test.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.850
Adult test 0, virtual subway test.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.850
Adult test start.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.060
What happened?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.160
What's this?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.660
Subway?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.900
Please have a seat.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.270
What happened?

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.980
It's not permitted to grab this?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
So...

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.450
Test over, test over.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.730
What the hell?!

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.230
Excuse me, when did all of this started?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.400
You really don't know?

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.040
You know we need to get a license to prove that we are adult from last year, right?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.480
Ah?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.650
Or you don't read any newspaper or news?

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.680
That's right...

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.020
The crime has been increasing this year.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.620
Many parents do some childish crime.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.760
Like they killed their childern.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.660
So, people need to got a license to be an adult.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.730
People was here

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.330
to take the test, get the license?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.900
Yep.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.600
However, here is the special training institute.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.140
For the people who arrested without license.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.140
Before you could pass all the test and get the license.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.810
You cannot get out of here.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.580
How come?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.590
That's true.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.360
That's me.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.170
The Adult Road.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.770
Cannot take the priority seat.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.580
Grab by single arm.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.380
Is this OK?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.300
Ah, under this circumstance

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.470
If you are standing by a women,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.840
you need to put up your hands to clarify that you're not a freak.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.780
This is OK.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.250
I just got the technique.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.320
Hi, hi!

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.480
Really?

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.360
That's OK, take it easy.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.990
If I'm right, when I say this...

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.130
An adult need to point out the impolite manner with courage.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.810
But, I can not..

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.340
Why!

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.050
Point out, how to?

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.750
Test over, test over.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.590
It can't be.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.420
An adult need to point out...

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.790
Thank you.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.600
Thank you.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.230
I always stop here.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.570
I cannot point out other's fault.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.580
What's this?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.380
Ah, that day is my daughter's birthday.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.050
You got a daughter?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.390
Yes.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.760
Cute?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.800
I really want to graduate from here before that day.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.310
But I have no chance.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.210
I'll be forever child after all this.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.580
Forever child?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.680
People cannot graduate in one year.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.720
They have not got the second chance to be adult.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.720
They will be kicked out from here with a mark  "forever child" on their forehead.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.090
They will live life long with the humiliation of forever child.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.130
Without any freedom.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.230
No drink, no smoke.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.670
No work, no love affairs, of course no family.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.070
I...cannot

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.610
I cannot meet my daughter again.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.150
Thank you for coming.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.250
I don't expect it.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.060
I'm surprised.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.320
Me too.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.590
I'm surprised as well.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.160
To my surprise, you're still a child.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.000
No, it's because...

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.630
I cannot be with Yoji anymore.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.370
I cannot date with a child.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.710
Sorry.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.310
Just a moment, why this?

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.440
I can handle it.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.350
I already get the technique.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.310
It's not a big thing if you follow the rule.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.680
I'll be out soon.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.250
I fall in love with another guy.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.820
A real man with license.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.760
I said I'll be an adult soon.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.230
If I pass the test..

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.860
I'll pass the test soon, could you..

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.630
I don't mean to say that.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.370
I just want to say goodbye.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.600
As an adult woman.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.940
Wait! Wait!

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.210
Farewell.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.470
Yuka! Wait!

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.890
I have to  be an adult.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.830
I must take that.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.070
I must be a great adult.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.640
Remember that?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.610
You must remember!

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.780
Point out!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.350
Just point out.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.420
Could you bear to be a forever adult?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.490
Was it from live?

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.090
Not from live.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.690
Be quite!

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.130
Sorry.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:47.870
Sorry.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.930
Sorry.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.570
Sorry.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.840
That's OK.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.510
Well, this is it.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.250
It's OK?!

Don't do that.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.180
You cannot yell to them.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.120

It's lonely, right?

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.620
However,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.900
The people left by you must be sad.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.600
Your dad, mom, and your friend.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.870

I'll  say goodbye to my childish tomorrow!

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.200
At last!

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.340
Hi..

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.340
Could you please do me a favor?

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.010
How can I?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.710
Could you please help me?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.510

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.640
I want to say my daughter.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.280
I think I cannot graduate form here.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.050
So I want to escape to say my daughter.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.120
Just for once, I want to see her face.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.320
Please.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.500
Chapter 95, the way of persuation.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:41.470
Keep clam, clarify the situation with gentle, don't stimulate him, touch him with emotion.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.170
I deeply understand you.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.210
But.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.970
If you be caught.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.610
You'll be forever adult.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.490
Forget all that stupid idea.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.060
This is good for you.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.700
But...

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.800
We can work this out together.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.580
You're not alone.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.470
I was gone.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.080
Keep fighting, for me. ---Takashi

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.020

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.790

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.720
It's your last test.

This man want to escape.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.000
You have the authority to judge him for his guilty.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.770
Whether you are qualified depends on it.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.370

Break the rules. As an adult.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.280
How to deal with it?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.150
How should the guilty adult be ruled?

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.550
For..this...

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.320
What's up? Cannot say a word?

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.050
You have no idea?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.620

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.890

It's the duty of an adult.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.630
All crime need to be punished.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.370
